Everywhere again they discuss news about the ban on cryptocurrencies. At first I did not want to comment on this at all. The bottom line is: neither the Central Bank nor any other organization has influence on bitcoin. For some other cryptocurrencies - it is possible, but with bitcoin everything is definitely and understandable. A little story: there was a time when there was a high tax on the purchase/sale of dollars. And almost every branch of Sberbank (and there were almost no others then) there was a car with an enlarged photocopy of the dollar on the windshield. These were changing - the prototype of modern exchangers is crypts. Only in those days there was almost no Internet, and there was no online banking at all. What is the result: the Central Bank, Fed, CIA, KGB or anyone can throw anything and try to ban anything, but Bitcoin was created precisely taking into account such prohibitions. There are no technologies (and is not expected) that will allow all impostors even try to ban cryptocurrencies. All that the Central Bank can do: to ban P2P transfers (from a client to the client) in online banking and run to catch a change. Will they do it? If they do, then we will discuss the prohibitions. And in all other cases, this is an informational noise that they let them leave. Do not waste time on excess noise is how to discuss the ban on lace panties (there was such an initiative too, yeah).

I ran my eyes with the main theses of the three sources: the news from Bloomberg and the conference from the representative of the Central Bank is a mud, which is not even worth the fraction of attention. Regarding Binance - I’ll say once again - they are in full cooperation and there is an official representative in the Russian Federation. All data will be transmitted to the authorities - this is a matter of time. If there is a ban, they will give the funds. Such cases have already been more than once. But it is better not to store significant amounts on exchanges.

[2022-02-02 11:35:44] - @stealer:matrix.mtololo.com: It is possible that the Monero network itself does not follow, but customers can drain and somewhere. If I were a Monero developer, I would have done it)

[2022-02-08 08:29:14] - @felix:matrix.mtololo.com: I watched an interview, the person told you, "no one will look for you by IP, this is a gystalous business, Thor, VPN, Vhuniks, proxy. The providers do not lead the logs simply because they should not. . Many generally pay to the BTS, and some generally display on exchanges, or through exchangers to their cards "

Many generally pay to the BTS, only some take to Monero, and some generally transfer to the wallets of exchanges, or through exchangers to their cards " 

 We are looking for this, this is a reliable infa

[2022-02-08 11:12:42] - @felix:matrix.mtololo.com: In the same interview there was something new to me. About Monero, described above. Before that, I changed the BTS on Monero, then from Monero to Monero and thought that OK, grandmas are clean. Now the amers are analyzing transzes in terms of trading, and if the amounts converge, for example, transz in the Monero Equivalent network 10BTS and the same at the BCT network at the same time, then like trouble

[2022-02-08 11:16:46] - @win32:matrix.mtololo.com: Yes, it seems to me that the problem is with the conclusion. Do not care about amers, if the FSB really catches in Moscow

[2022-02-08 11:16:53] - @win32:matrix.mtololo.com: The trend is cocky

[2022-02-08 11:21:03] - @saint:matrix.mtololo.com: A friend recently changed 100kk

 You think so right now when you see your poster on the FBI website on the wanted list

[2022-02-08 11:27:38] - @felix:matrix.mtololo.com: you won't think so)

[2022-02-08 11:27:58] - @killanas:matrix.mtololo.com: I do not mean it

[2022-02-08 11:28:02] - @felix:matrix.mtololo.com: I do not want to be wanted until the end of the days or live within the framework of one country

[2022-02-08 11:28:17] - @killanas:matrix.mtololo.com: When you do not pay taxes. You give the percentage of the amount. 
 Well, here, and here, probably you should not be greedy and give a percentage.

[2022-02-08 11:29:23] - @killanas:matrix.mtololo.com: In plan, without jokes. I remove the grandmas through QR codes. I walk in a scarf and a hat wrapped. I bought cards for drops. I go to different ATMs. I leave the phone, etc.

[2022-02-08 11:30:40] - @felix:matrix.mtololo.com: Oh well, if the grandmas from the exchange exchange go out, then you can and on your cards, you will say that the crypto -investor, trader, etc.

[2022-02-08 11:30:47] - @killanas:matrix.mtololo.com: Paranoia also fucks. Although the amount was not as Saint wrote. But the soul is calm)

[2022-02-08 11:30:55] - @killanas:matrix.mtololo.com: Although the percentage will go there

[2022-02-08 11:32:10] - @felix:matrix.mtololo.com: And there is no need to invent anything if there is a income tax from investments to pay it and withdraw it to your card, the grandmas are clean

[2022-02-08 11:32:45] - @felix:matrix.mtololo.com: And so you will buy a hut from grandmas from the maps of the drops, and then think so that they do not ask where the grandmas

[2022-02-08 11:34:53] - @killanas:matrix.mtololo.com: About the hut and where the grandmothers come from. 
 Then, as it were, logically we approach the fact that it would be something to shoot, pour, change.

[2022-02-08 11:36:31] - @killanas:matrix.mtololo.com: Well, there are two different questions) how to remove the grandmas and how to show where the grandmas came from) the second question is seen relatively simple compared to the first

[2022-02-08 11:38:06] - @killanas:matrix.mtololo.com: So I will deal with the first question then)

[2022-02-08 11:40:26] - @killanas:matrix.mtololo.com: Well, more precisely, the question of how to make money and not how to remove)

[2022-02-08 11:41:13] - @felix:matrix.mtololo.com: Yes, you were all understood from the first post)

[2022-02-08 11:41:51] - @killanas:matrix.mtololo.com: But in general it seemed to me? Or real, something has increased the number of all sorts of detentions in the Russian Federation?

[2022-02-08 11:42:08] - @felix:matrix.mtololo.com: MB simply began to be published

[2022-02-08 11:42:18] - @felix:matrix.mtololo.com: could quietly delay earlier and all

[2022-02-08 11:42:29] - @killanas:matrix.mtololo.com: It's just interesting as at a distance of 2-3 years

[2022-02-08 11:42:32] - @felix:matrix.mtololo.com: I think nothing has changed, they just began to shout about it in the media

[2022-02-08 11:43:08] - @killanas:matrix.mtololo.com: Yes, knowing how in the Russian Federation it happens. Could change somewhere and that's it. The boss changed - the approach has changed

[2022-02-08 11:43:29] - @killanas:matrix.mtololo.com: Well, like why take a percentage from bandits, change the approach, we will push everything off

[2022-02-08 11:43:47] - @felix:matrix.mtololo.com: Yes, no one takes % from the bandits

[2022-02-08 11:43:51] - @felix:matrix.mtololo.com: I doubt very much

[2022-02-08 11:44:02] - @felix:matrix.mtololo.com: that someone caught it straight, and declared % in the month

[2022-02-08 11:44:21] - @felix:matrix.mtololo.com: since they took as much as they could, and all

[2022-02-08 11:44:29] - @win32:matrix.mtololo.com: Well, three detentions per month, isn't it an indicator?

[2022-02-08 11:44:30] - @felix:matrix.mtololo.com: or did not take and the bandit went to court

[2022-02-08 11:44:43] - @win32:matrix.mtololo.com: Moreover, those KT about did not work according to RU. Revil - dick with him, it was clear there

[2022-02-08 11:45:42] - @felix:matrix.mtololo.com: just worked out those who have already been known, you look at the plums of the forums

[2022-02-08 11:45:46] - @felix:matrix.mtololo.com: There is soap

[2022-02-08 11:45:52] - @felix:matrix.mtololo.com: There are personal correspondence

[2022-02-08 11:46:33] - @felix:matrix.mtololo.com: They did so

[2022-02-08 11:46:42] - @felix:matrix.mtololo.com: Where then is such mass?

[2022-02-08 11:47:01] - @felix:matrix.mtololo.com: Given what to do this will not 1 person, but by the forces of the state

[2022-02-08 11:48:23] - @felix:matrix.mtololo.com: And let's add to the banking database the merged databases, Mirtsen, Lovheplanet, Mamba

[2022-02-08 11:48:24] - @felix:matrix.mtololo.com: PPC will be complete)

[2022-02-08 11:48:25] - @felix:matrix.mtololo.com: Even Masafaka, devoted, their database in the public lie)

[2022-02-08 11:48:28] - @felix:matrix.mtololo.com: BHF is the same, explosa is 2009 Date drainage

[2022-02-08 11:49:05] - @felix:matrix.mtololo.com: Come on, you were released back in 2009, could not fold 2+2, and used your personal soap, in 2013 you became a hard hacker, retired and made a new accounting coat

[2022-02-08 11:49:23] - @felix:matrix.mtololo.com: So it's too late, because the Internet remembers everything

[2022-02-08 11:50:05] - @felix:matrix.mtololo.com: And now imagine the situation, Comrade Major mocks the dump of 2009 Expa, finds you there, and then your TIN mocks you in real life, and finds 4 cars and 3 apartments

[2022-02-08 11:54:07] - @felix:matrix.mtololo.com: Do you think the FSB cannot go there with a search and pick up the entire database?

[2022-02-09 16:39:21] - @felix:matrix.mtololo.com: it's just the arrogance of the maximum level

The United States’s inability to go to negotiations with Russia on security from the position of dialogue without open pressure quite logically came to naught and the rates made to cooperate on the fight against cyberosis.
The Russian leadership no longer see the meaning of the fight against hacker groups in the country, which was determined by the previous agreements with Washington.

The large -scale cyber attacks observed throughout the development of the Ukrainian case, the activated DDOS of Russian state and banking sites, which are organized with obvious non -resistance, and often support, American relevant structures, in the conditions of a new world order “deprive cooperation of meaning”.

The November “Meeting Steps”, made in the format of closed negotiations with the transfer of Russia's information about hackers who arranged massive attacks on Western players, are actually canceled.

However, the fate of the already detained cyber-criminals who controlled the beam programs is not yet clear, but for Washington the signal is obvious and ... unpleasant.
