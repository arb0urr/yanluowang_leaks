[2022-01-17 10:49:16] - @killanas:matrix.mtololo.com: Hello.

[2022-01-17 10:49:45] - @killanas:matrix.mtololo.com: According to the morpher, the main goal is a decrease in detectives?

[2022-01-17 13:00:48] - @saint:matrix.mtololo.com: Yes

[2022-01-17 13:00:52] - @saint:matrix.mtololo.com: And remove the patterns

[2022-01-17 13:00:58] - @saint:matrix.mtololo.com: that they could not appear at all)

[2022-01-17 13:02:18] - @killanas:matrix.mtololo.com: Of course this is ideal)

[2022-01-17 13:02:36] - @killanas:matrix.mtololo.com: How do you like my Ava?) I took an example from you)

[2022-01-17 13:02:45] - @saint:matrix.mtololo.com: normal

[2022-01-17 13:02:48] - @saint:matrix.mtololo.com: But this is Kazakh in my opinion

[2022-01-17 13:03:00] - @killanas:matrix.mtololo.com: Google issued the Chinese on the issue.

[2022-01-17 13:03:05] - @killanas:matrix.mtololo.com: On request

[2022-01-17 13:03:32] - @killanas:matrix.mtololo.com: But yes) it looks like Saburov and Skriptonite)

[2022-01-18 06:28:00] - @killanas:matrix.mtololo.com: Under the morpher, I understand that this is what is loaded from the disk into memory and unpackens the useful load in memory then changes it every time in different ways (focuses) 
 At the same time, there will be one and the same binar on the disk that will fall over time 
 The option is still possible that the morfer changes directly in itself pieces of code that can fall under the signature 
 But the algorithm for changing these pieces will also fall asleep because it is the same. 
 We now had detectives mainly on a disk. 
 That is, when it is recorded on the disc, Aver checks it.

[2022-01-18 06:28:06] - @killanas:matrix.mtololo.com: What is recorded on the disk.

[2022-01-19 10:48:18] - @saint:matrix.mtololo.com: Pieces of code

[2022-01-19 10:48:24] - @saint:matrix.mtololo.com: and disk

[2022-01-19 11:10:57] - @killanas:matrix.mtololo.com: Under the morpher you understand that the locker will be unpacked in memory every time each time?

[2022-01-19 11:11:46] - @killanas:matrix.mtololo.com: Or is the fact that the machine code in the executable file on the disk will be different?

[2022-01-20 06:24:00] - @saint:matrix.mtololo.com: both that and that)))))

[2022-01-20 07:19:24] - @killanas:matrix.mtololo.com: How much will it be on coins?)

[2022-01-21 13:12:30] - @killanas:matrix.mtololo.com: Hello. I can't handle it in IS. He took a lot of time, but the campaign does not have enough skill.

[2022-01-21 13:13:25] - @killanas:matrix.mtololo.com: According to reverse silk in legitimate software. There are progress. More precisely in Timweuver, there is an opportunity to slip your Libe.

[2022-01-21 13:14:04] - @killanas:matrix.mtololo.com: If relevant, of course.

[2022-01-21 13:16:25] - @killanas:matrix.mtololo.com: If you take some kind of media player and so on as a legitimate software. Then you can find sources and shove anything. From the examples of what you gave (TM and Eni Desk) hard. 
 But with Timka he seemed to find an approach, despite his defense.

[2022-01-22 19:08:12] - @saint:matrix.mtololo.com: Timka Enidesk only

[2022-01-22 19:11:31] - @killanas:matrix.mtololo.com: Understood

[2022-01-24 08:04:27] - @saint:matrix.mtololo.com: Throw away the lpea

[2022-01-24 08:46:23] - @killanas:matrix.mtololo.com: But in memory of the three password symbols precisely from the assembly that I gave

[2022-01-24 09:33:09] - @killanas:matrix.mtololo.com: Everything is clear

[2022-01-24 09:34:15] - @killanas:matrix.mtololo.com: It doesn't work under my developers

[2022-01-24 09:34:24] - @killanas:matrix.mtololo.com: But there is a build possible some kind of non -standard

[2022-01-24 09:34:31] - @killanas:matrix.mtololo.com: It is cut

[2022-01-24 11:38:44] - @killanas:matrix.mtololo.com: Works ?

[2022-01-29 01:29:21] - @saint:matrix.mtololo.com: who is that?

[2022-01-29 01:29:25] - @saint:matrix.mtololo.com: And where did he get the Surs

[2022-01-29 01:30:14] - @killanas:matrix.mtololo.com: Fucking. There, coding specialists ran immediately. On the CSS as usual.

[2022-01-29 01:30:22] - @killanas:matrix.mtololo.com: > <@sain: matrix.mtolololo.com> and where did the Surs come from 

 I have the same question so far

[2022-01-29 01:30:32] - @killanas:matrix.mtololo.com: I only threw you and the styler and the styler

[2022-01-29 01:30:35] - @killanas:matrix.mtololo.com: A long time ago

[2022-01-29 01:30:43] - @saint:matrix.mtololo.com: Are they on GITA?

[2022-01-29 01:30:51] - @killanas:matrix.mtololo.com: Screenshots with soon

[2022-01-29 01:31:00] - @killanas:matrix.mtololo.com: We do not use this idea

[2022-01-29 01:31:07] - @killanas:matrix.mtololo.com: > <@sain: matrix.mtololo.com> on GITA we have? 

 Yes. Of course

[2022-01-29 01:31:16] - @saint:matrix.mtololo.com: Could someone take someone from yours?

[2022-01-29 01:31:19] - @saint:matrix.mtololo.com: Stiller is silent

[2022-01-29 01:31:55] - @killanas:matrix.mtololo.com: > <@sain: matrix.mtololo.com> could someone take someone from yours? 

 Well, about which I drank

[2022-01-29 01:31:58] - @killanas:matrix.mtololo.com: Codera

[2022-01-29 01:32:10] - @saint:matrix.mtololo.com: Can he?

[2022-01-29 01:32:32] - @killanas:matrix.mtololo.com: > <@sain: matrix.mtololo.com> Can he? 

 Well, theoretically, everyone who had access can take.

[2022-01-29 01:32:43] - @killanas:matrix.mtololo.com: But I have not known him for 8 years.

[2022-01-29 01:33:01] - @saint:matrix.mtololo.com: Well, there are people judging by the message

[2022-01-29 01:33:04] - @killanas:matrix.mtololo.com: I personally know everyone from mine for a very long time

[2022-01-29 01:33:05] - @saint:matrix.mtololo.com: does not know who the customer

[2022-01-29 01:33:09] - @saint:matrix.mtololo.com: And he thinks that the Chinese

[2022-01-29 01:33:10] - @saint:matrix.mtololo.com: )

[2022-01-29 01:33:33] - @saint:matrix.mtololo.com: Che for the horseradish, left straight in sight at least anyone wants to take and download:

[2022-01-29 01:33:37] - @saint:matrix.mtololo.com: Change all the credits to the guit

[2022-01-29 01:33:41] - @saint:matrix.mtololo.com: I will ask you to transfer

[2022-01-29 01:33:43] - @killanas:matrix.mtololo.com: I had a long time ago that the Surts will run away. You said that fuck. 
 I just can't understand how much current code

[2022-01-29 01:33:45] - @saint:matrix.mtololo.com: MB broke someone

[2022-01-29 01:34:15] - @killanas:matrix.mtololo.com: I hope without distribution)

[2022-01-29 01:34:24] - @killanas:matrix.mtololo.com: And without sheds of the morpher)

[2022-01-29 01:34:32] - @saint:matrix.mtololo.com: Well, if you have to throw it into the public

[2022-01-29 01:34:34] - @saint:matrix.mtololo.com: And saw the new one

[2022-01-29 01:34:35] - @saint:matrix.mtololo.com: With 0

[2022-01-29 01:34:40] - @saint:matrix.mtololo.com: I am already

[2022-01-29 01:34:47] - @saint:matrix.mtololo.com: Everything was fucked up

[2022-01-29 01:35:10] - @killanas:matrix.mtololo.com: > <@sain: matrix.mtololo.com> I will retire 

 What kind of pension) I have not yet earned a hut) come on later)

[2022-01-29 01:35:33] - @killanas:matrix.mtololo.com: Then we will change the axis at all workplaces

[2022-01-29 01:36:14] - @killanas:matrix.mtololo.com: And I will probably physically endure everything

[2022-01-29 01:37:08] - @killanas:matrix.mtololo.com: I would look at the Log Gita, just in case

[2022-01-29 01:40:13] - @killanas:matrix.mtololo.com: Well, in distribution, there is another idea how to cut it completely from scratch and quite effective.

[2022-01-29 01:40:28] - @killanas:matrix.mtololo.com: But if the lock is cut off from scratch

[2022-01-29 01:46:41] - @killanas:matrix.mtololo.com: > <@sain: matrix.mtololo.com> https://xss.is/threads/61997/#post-413541 

 What kind of nonsense he wrote in the topic

[2022-01-29 02:00:23] - @saint:matrix.mtololo.com: Are you sure that ours is sure?

[2022-01-29 02:00:34] - @saint:matrix.mtololo.com: In Hellokitty a piece of code with Taskkill /F /IM * also used

[2022-01-29 02:00:38] - @saint:matrix.mtololo.com: And the pass to launch was also

[2022-01-29 02:10:54] - @killanas:matrix.mtololo.com: I look at the more attentive

[2022-01-29 02:11:49] - @saint:matrix.mtololo.com: Their Malvar is complete shit, my grandmother could write better than all this hell. 
 Of course, Artem will deny, but he knows that this is true. I know this myself, everyone from Conti knows. 
 I would have a lean if I could.

[2022-01-29 02:11:53] - @saint:matrix.mtololo.com: definitely not about you?)

[2022-01-29 02:13:49] - @saint:matrix.mtololo.com: aa

[2022-01-29 02:13:53] - @saint:matrix.mtololo.com: Exactly from jangovang it is

[2022-01-29 02:14:14] - @killanas:matrix.mtololo.com: > <@sain: matrix.mtololo.com> definitely not about you?) 

 Well, I am well treated only to the exploit, there the comrades mainly in the case are dostering people. 
 And on the CSS, I tried to make a topic on the reverse, well, one person turned, well, I could not remove him a linux binding, well, wrote about it. 
 So fucked me there, there was a type of business for 5 minutes, and so on. Therefore, I am not sitting on the XSS.

[2022-01-29 02:14:19] - @killanas:matrix.mtololo.com: > <@sain: matrix.mtololo.com> Tma .yanluowng 

 Yes

[2022-01-29 02:14:27] - @killanas:matrix.mtololo.com: there the type on trendmikro even gave Link)

[2022-01-29 02:14:39] - @saint:matrix.mtololo.com: I haven't seen just this piece

[2022-01-29 02:14:42] - @saint:matrix.mtololo.com: Now I saw

[2022-01-29 02:16:01] - @killanas:matrix.mtololo.com: Something shakes me

[2022-01-29 02:16:26] - @saint:matrix.mtololo.com: Okay, at least wrote people that customers are Chinese

[2022-01-29 02:16:26] - @saint:matrix.mtololo.com: )

[2022-01-29 02:16:59] - @killanas:matrix.mtololo.com: Yes, he wrote some kind of tin)

[2022-01-29 02:17:10] - @killanas:matrix.mtololo.com: > <@sain: matrix.mtololo.com> Okay, at least wrote people that customers are Chinese 

 I agree)

[2022-01-29 02:17:56] - @killanas:matrix.mtololo.com: Just where the code comes from ...

[2022-01-29 02:18:01] - @killanas:matrix.mtololo.com: ran away

[2022-01-29 02:18:05] - @saint:matrix.mtololo.com: Do you have credits on the ramp?

[2022-01-29 02:18:09] - @killanas:matrix.mtololo.com: her

[2022-01-29 02:18:14] - @killanas:matrix.mtololo.com: I am current at the Exp and XSS

[2022-01-29 02:18:15] - @saint:matrix.mtololo.com: Do you know Syllka?

[2022-01-29 02:18:18] - @saint:matrix.mtololo.com: I want to see what there

[2022-01-29 02:18:41] - @killanas:matrix.mtololo.com: No, I'll look for it now too

[2022-01-29 02:26:33] - @killanas:matrix.mtololo.com: And anyone else was given?

[2022-01-29 02:26:44] - @saint:matrix.mtololo.com: No

[2022-01-29 02:38:50] - @killanas:matrix.mtololo.com: > <@sain: matrix.mtololo.com> definitely not about you?) 

 That the cup code is definitely not about us) 
 Tasks are completed, so the code is fucked up) 
 But to seduce that he is fucking every 2 is ready)

[2022-01-29 02:39:03] - @killanas:matrix.mtololo.com: 3 screens of our piece of iron, 3 is not clear

[2022-01-29 02:52:22] - @killanas:matrix.mtololo.com: Listen. That what am I worried about. On the contrary, it turns out, everything is as you wanted, to the Chinese, Trikbots, Conti, Ramp all arrows. 
 In fact, from us, only react to the incident. 
 1) Understand the relevance 
 2) try to understand where they spids

[2022-01-29 02:52:42] - @killanas:matrix.mtololo.com: > <@sain: matrix.mtololo.com> Okay, at least wrote people that customers are Chinese 

 Everything is as you planned)

[2022-01-29 05:26:43] - @killanas:matrix.mtololo.com: > <@sain: matrix.mtololo.com> could someone take someone from yours? 

 Mine are all happy to the conjure from the money received, it cannot be that they were offended by money. Neither those who right now, nor who he drank.

[2022-01-29 05:26:58] - @killanas:matrix.mtololo.com: There is a Committee on November 23 at GITA. There we changed lines

[2022-01-29 05:27:08] - @killanas:matrix.mtololo.com: They differ from those on the screen in Persisten

[2022-01-29 05:27:27] - @killanas:matrix.mtololo.com: I think if they were spinding with a guita. That was the last version

[2022-01-29 05:30:38] - @killanas:matrix.mtololo.com: There are still differences just in the encoding. Recall the date when there were trabes in the case with encoding

[2022-01-29 05:34:31] - @killanas:matrix.mtololo.com: Image.png

[2022-01-29 05:34:52] - @killanas:matrix.mtololo.com: Do you have a file left with the sources that I dropped?

[2022-01-29 05:35:06] - @killanas:matrix.mtololo.com: You and the styler. About October

[2022-01-29 05:35:25] - @saint:matrix.mtololo.com: nope

[2022-01-29 09:08:11] - @killanas:matrix.mtololo.com: Well, I caught up with the campaign where I (we) could fuck the sources

[2022-01-29 09:13:26] - @killanas:matrix.mtololo.com: Hit has nothing to do and no one caught the styler

[2022-01-29 13:49:32] - @saint:matrix.mtololo.com: where

[2022-01-29 13:53:30] - @killanas:matrix.mtololo.com: But again, the assumption. Where, according to the automatic emergency, just leave the source. There was a server rdpshny. They debugged on it when the bug was another. Either with the size of the felts with something else.

[2022-01-29 13:54:15] - @saint:matrix.mtololo.com: C lbcrfv

[2022-01-29 13:54:17] - @saint:matrix.mtololo.com: With disks?

[2022-01-29 13:54:24] - @killanas:matrix.mtololo.com: Most likely

[2022-01-29 13:54:31] - @saint:matrix.mtololo.com: There all the discs erased in 0

[2022-01-29 13:54:38] - @saint:matrix.mtololo.com: And physically destroyed

[2022-01-29 13:54:46] - @killanas:matrix.mtololo.com: Well, so the version of the EVEN COD until November 23 judging by Gita

[2022-01-29 13:55:04] - @saint:matrix.mtololo.com: Well, so we only had access there

[2022-01-29 13:55:10] - @saint:matrix.mtololo.com: And he appeared later

[2022-01-29 13:55:14] - @killanas:matrix.mtololo.com: Well, Stler said the same thing

[2022-01-29 13:55:19] - @killanas:matrix.mtololo.com: That you only had and me

[2022-01-29 13:55:28] - @killanas:matrix.mtololo.com: Well, he also has but he did not go there

[2022-01-29 13:56:06] - @killanas:matrix.mtololo.com: Well, that is, you did not give anyone from this server in October November Credia? Well, except me and the styler

[2022-02-01 10:58:46] - @killanas:matrix.mtololo.com: I thought a percentage) or how are we?) Or is it only for the date?

[2022-02-01 10:58:53] - @saint:matrix.mtololo.com: percent

[2022-02-01 11:30:31] - @killanas:matrix.mtololo.com: > <@sain: matrix.mtololo.com> Why do you need this infa? 

 It is clear why there may be such a question. But I'm not going to deal with dicks.

[2022-02-01 11:30:45] - @killanas:matrix.mtololo.com: On the lpees this result

[2022-02-01 11:31:25] - @killanas:matrix.mtololo.com: Changes.rar

[2022-02-01 11:35:07] - @killanas:matrix.mtololo.com: I don't know how the functionality has changed, only the size of the records are increased, but how it affects

[2022-02-01 11:35:15] - @killanas:matrix.mtololo.com: I went to comparison all the files

[2022-02-01 11:35:34] - @killanas:matrix.mtololo.com: The new code is more informative - that is, with tests it is clear what has broken in a particular case

[2022-02-01 11:58:30] - @saint:matrix.mtololo.com: > <@killanas: matrix.mtolololo.com> It is clear why there may be such a question. But I'm not going to deal with dicks. 

 What is the garbage?

[2022-02-01 13:25:04] - @killanas:matrix.mtololo.com: Well, like UNKANOVN with a signature cursed. That the key Dasha was leaked after the agreement

[2022-02-01 13:25:15] - @killanas:matrix.mtololo.com: That the terepils will pay

[2022-02-01 13:25:59] - @killanas:matrix.mtololo.com: I just wanted to estimate the possible arrival of the money

[2022-02-04 11:45:42] - @killanas:matrix.mtololo.com: Hello. 
 1. Check, for the last time the locker as a whole without nicks? 
 You just said that 70-90 percent was not polished. With a Hedle is Invalid error. 
 This question does not let me go. 
 (I remember about Path-IP) 
 2. Has it worked out? 
 3. The poor fellow did not pay? )) I am interested in based on the fact that I (we) are on the percentage (well, or do I not bother you after each build?)

[2022-02-04 11:49:58] - @killanas:matrix.mtololo.com: The condition of the current detectives as a whole on the face in the group. 
 In general, everything is clear, the signatures on the lines, clean and wrap it already clear how. 
 Morfer is still in work, but you can see an intermediate result.

[2022-02-04 12:20:50] - @killanas:matrix.mtololo.com: But of course there will also be detectives over time

[2022-02-04 13:22:02] - @saint:matrix.mtololo.com: Are these questions?

[2022-02-22 19:17:19] - @killanas:matrix.mtololo.com: Well, in order of information. On mobile emulators for Votsap is ready for a dictation and a dictation. You can try to try it.

[2022-02-22 19:17:37] - @killanas:matrix.mtololo.com: Can Facebook under the messenger immediately plug it?

[2022-02-22 19:17:48] - @saint:matrix.mtololo.com: what Facebook

[2022-02-22 19:18:03] - @killanas:matrix.mtololo.com: I don't know what. They are being used

[2022-02-22 19:18:51] - @killanas:matrix.mtololo.com: Well, we discussed that there would be no mobile call?

[2022-02-22 19:19:09] - @saint:matrix.mtololo.com: What does Facebook have to do with it?

[2022-02-22 19:19:10] - @killanas:matrix.mtololo.com: Or should it be mobile for anyone?

[2022-02-22 19:19:15] - @killanas:matrix.mtololo.com: BUT

[2022-02-22 19:20:34] - @killanas:matrix.mtololo.com: > <@sain: matrix.mtololo.com> What does Facebook have to do with it? 

 Well, as far as I know, in Yusa there is a mobile application Facebook messenger. And all statistics they use it very actively on mobile devices. So I thought that the coverage would be wider.

[2022-02-22 19:21:04] - @saint:matrix.mtololo.com: Yeah

[2022-02-22 19:21:06] - @saint:matrix.mtololo.com: And how do we know

[2022-02-22 19:21:13] - @saint:matrix.mtololo.com: Where to call Facebook

[2022-02-22 19:21:16] - @saint:matrix.mtololo.com: By phone number

[2022-02-22 19:21:26] - @killanas:matrix.mtololo.com: Well, yes. Through the import of contacts

[2022-02-22 19:21:39] - @killanas:matrix.mtololo.com: But on Facebook it will most likely fail

[2022-02-22 19:23:03] - @killanas:matrix.mtololo.com: Well, in general. Under Votsap is ready. 
 If suddenly it makes sense to Facebook. I would look at how it is and what can be done at present.

[2022-02-22 19:23:12] - @saint:matrix.mtololo.com: Well, how

[2022-02-22 19:23:15] - @saint:matrix.mtololo.com: You will find what you need

[2022-02-22 19:23:18] - @saint:matrix.mtololo.com: On Facebook, then

[2022-02-22 19:28:59] - @killanas:matrix.mtololo.com: Now most likely it has been fixed. But earlier you can in VK and OD, make the imports of contacts of the directory into a mobile application. 
 Actually, the Mob of the application gave the page of the Zaregnoy user by number (if you score 1 contact in the reference book, then it gave 1 page, then we need to). 

 How now, you need to look) the question is in that is it relevant? Or will there be enough wotsap?)

[2022-02-22 19:29:17] - @saint:matrix.mtololo.com: I do not know

[2022-02-22 19:29:21] - @saint:matrix.mtololo.com: In Yusa Vatsap is popular?

[2022-03-03 13:50:56] - @killanas:matrix.mtololo.com: So there you figured out the floor?

Current Chat status:
++ 1 - The whole panel should work in the Torah
++ 2 - The panel should have an admin panel, to which we will only have access to us
- It will be necessary to make it the pentest, to look at the presence of vulnerabilities immediately)
++ 3 - in principle, I don’t care what engine, the main thing is not holey, and not inhibiting in the Torah
++ 4 - from the side of the thoroughness there will be 1 Sylka, on the panel itself in the Torah, it will introduce the name of the corps there, and with the name of the Sylka will be generated on the chat itself, tobill as the case will be called the chat in our admin panel + should be called + Silka herself is visible for a chat in admin
++ 5 - from the side of the tolela should not be visible online or not, whether we read or not a message,
++ And on our part there should be infa - whether our message is read when they answered it (just the time of departure
-Also, the number of people who are sitting right now sitting on the side of the Syll in the chat (+-5 minute interval will go, Tobesh went and left after 5 minutes, we will see it)
++ 6 - the ability to reduce messages and delete them
- 7 - also the story of the time in time for Sylka in the chat was tolerated
- 8 - from the side tolerated, the ability to applaud files to us (on the test cheap) limit 10 MB 1 file
++ 9 - you need to make in the admin panel not super users the ability to write, but not to reduce and delete messages
readers and so on
which will simply see from the side of the admin panel, to which we can give them access
++ design does not care, the main thing is not to look out

[2022-03-03 13:51:45] - @killanas:matrix.mtololo.com: Where the disadvantages are not purely due to time, there are no technical problems.

[2022-03-11 06:06:51] - @killanas:matrix.mtololo.com: Well, and a wrapping in the Torah that will give a login and password for

[2022-03-11 06:06:57] - @killanas:matrix.mtololo.com: Well, the base is to be used to whom binar is issued

[2022-03-11 06:06:58] - @saint:matrix.mtololo.com: And how do you understand from which binary

[2022-03-11 06:07:00] - @saint:matrix.mtololo.com: key

[2022-03-11 06:07:48] - @saint:matrix.mtololo.com: separate?

[2022-03-11 06:08:10] - @killanas:matrix.mtololo.com: I can do Exsey with Windows. I can drag Binari from his server.

[2022-03-13 14:21:48] - @saint:matrix.mtololo.com: well, you can have a design and to spouse

[2022-03-13 14:22:53] - @killanas:matrix.mtololo.com: Well, you can tie + add your thoughts, as you suggested, maybe something else.

[2022-03-13 14:23:23] - @killanas:matrix.mtololo.com: I am still a designer) but somehow I think you can give an info more structurally

[2022-03-13 14:23:29] - @saint:matrix.mtololo.com: Yes

[2022-03-13 14:23:53] - @killanas:matrix.mtololo.com: it may even be possible to prevent content filtering

[2022-03-13 14:24:22] - @killanas:matrix.mtololo.com: Well, we like making a search line in the web. People are looking for data.

[2022-03-13 14:24:30] - @killanas:matrix.mtololo.com: Well, send all sorts of requests

[2022-03-13 14:24:49] - @killanas:matrix.mtololo.com: like Phone Number, SSN, Driver Number, etc.

[2022-03-13 14:25:30] - @killanas:matrix.mtololo.com: And we can log in these requests and based on their requests to make the priorities of information that is interesting to people.

[2022-03-25 12:22:54] - @killanas:matrix.mtololo.com: Hello. 
 From the moment of the last verification, not particularly progress, well, that is, in empty times, fucked up. The approach was not a worker. Well, you can call it as you like. 
 Now the thought has been thrown. I think (well, at least I hope) it will work out.

[2022-03-25 13:04:58] - @killanas:matrix.mtololo.com: Well, as it were, I immediately treated it with cautiously and understood that I would not do it quickly.

[2022-03-25 13:07:47] - @killanas:matrix.mtololo.com: I think after there is success, it will be possible to repeat iterations for cleaning in a shorter time, due to the fact that I will not spend time on unnecessary things, the code will be familiar, etc.

[2022-03-26 05:47:41] - @saint:matrix.mtololo.com: Try to attach the ceres and change the icon

[2022-03-26 05:47:43] - @saint:matrix.mtololo.com: MB will help

[2022-03-26 05:50:49] - @killanas:matrix.mtololo.com: I don't think it will help, but I'll try

[2022-03-26 05:51:44] - @killanas:matrix.mtololo.com: About these tests made such (which benefited): 
 1. Unexpectedly -> -3 ABBOVED (Fortinet, Webroot, Cylance) 
 2. Replacing memory of VirtuallOC memory with HeAPALLOC -> -3 AV minus (Fortinet, Webroot, Cylance) 
 3. True wrapping in RC4-> -2 AB minus (Trend Micro, McAfee) 
 4. Use Syswhisper V.1 -> +1 AB (Cylance) 
 5. The use of the morpher on the build in paragraph 4 -> -3 AB (Kaspersky, Cylance, Symantec) 
 Ideas 
 1. Syswhisper V2 (already in the process) 
 2. Change of encryption key configa bicon 
 3. Garbage inserts, calls 

 What remains to achieve: 
 Remove Detectes with Sophos and Blood

[2022-03-29 10:30:50] - @killanas:matrix.mtololo.com: And so as not to shove nothing touched

[2022-03-29 10:30:59] - @killanas:matrix.mtololo.com: you need to break the token in the program

[2022-03-29 10:58:04] - @saint:matrix.mtololo.com: everything is working

[2022-03-29 13:26:43] - @killanas:matrix.mtololo.com: well, more precisely, there is a part of the tests on the morpher

[2022-03-29 13:26:56] - @killanas:matrix.mtololo.com: and two extreme ones are not signed and signed bicon

[2022-03-29 13:27:27] - @killanas:matrix.mtololo.com: It seems like a rather bad result.

[2022-03-29 14:04:20] - @saint:matrix.mtololo.com: Yes, OK

[2022-03-29 14:10:33] - @killanas:matrix.mtololo.com: Well, that is, on Morfer fucked up the strength was spent

[2022-03-29 14:11:17] - @killanas:matrix.mtololo.com: It may not be my business, but as it were, it would be clear that the detectives will also be thrown on it.

[2022-03-29 14:11:57] - @killanas:matrix.mtololo.com: If you (we) will issue builds in the web. Whether it will not be possible to appear relatively more/faster.

[2022-03-29 14:12:12] - @killanas:matrix.mtololo.com: Well, like the proportion spent forces and profit

[2022-03-29 14:12:29] - @saint:matrix.mtololo.com: will not work

[2022-03-29 14:12:30] - @saint:matrix.mtololo.com: do not mind it

[2022-03-29 14:12:58] - @killanas:matrix.mtololo.com: Then we checked Road Map?

[2022-03-29 14:13:04] - @saint:matrix.mtololo.com: OK

[2022-03-29 14:13:08] - @killanas:matrix.mtololo.com: Well, like what to do next?

[2022-03-29 14:13:24] - @killanas:matrix.mtololo.com: There were fixes on the webcam along the little things. Combustion in fact.

[2022-03-29 14:13:25] - @saint:matrix.mtololo.com: The leakage site is ready?

[2022-03-29 14:13:33] - @killanas:matrix.mtololo.com: > <@sain: matrix.mtololo.com> Ready leakage site? 

 It has not yet begun

[2022-03-29 14:13:37] - @saint:matrix.mtololo.com: Well, him

[2022-03-29 14:15:11] - @killanas:matrix.mtololo.com: OK. 
 1) Combination of the chat 
 2) Sprinking of the issuance of Exasi builds (I am waiting for API from the styler) 
 3) the leakage site (so far nothing) 
 4) Add to UNC locker (History but not yet, due to switching to Kobu)

[2022-03-29 14:15:37] - @saint:matrix.mtololo.com: first and 4 change in places)

[2022-03-29 14:16:05] - @killanas:matrix.mtololo.com: With UNC a whole story ... dohren to rewrite ...

[2022-03-29 14:16:26] - @saint:matrix.mtololo.com: Well, while there are no Targets

[2022-03-29 14:16:28] - @saint:matrix.mtololo.com: better now

[2022-03-29 14:17:38] - @saint:matrix.mtololo.com: On a koba, when are the result going to ask me?

[2022-03-29 14:20:03] - @killanas:matrix.mtololo.com: > <@sain: matrix.mtololo.com> on a koba, when do you get the result to convey to me? 

 For good, while you need to test the work with the server for samples that are screech

[2022-03-29 14:20:18] - @saint:matrix.mtololo.com: VSM

[2022-03-29 14:20:20] - @killanas:matrix.mtololo.com: It depends on the urgency

[2022-03-29 14:20:22] - @saint:matrix.mtololo.com: what did you do?

[2022-03-29 14:21:36] - @killanas:matrix.mtololo.com: > <@sain: matrix.mtololo.com> first and 4 change places) 

 understood. Here pararally. for 1 and 2 E separate person. I did not do anything here

[2022-03-29 14:22:17] - @saint:matrix.mtololo.com: So

[2022-03-29 14:22:22] - @saint:matrix.mtololo.com: Did you just saw a cryptor?

[2022-03-29 14:22:28] - @saint:matrix.mtololo.com: Or I didn't understand you

[2022-03-29 14:24:42] - @killanas:matrix.mtololo.com: > <@sain: matrix.mtololo.com> what did you do? 

 I am fixed by the Coba artifact code, I also sawed Syswispher2, which Winapi replaces with siskol directly, and covered it on top of its custom cryptor

[2022-03-29 14:25:02] - @saint:matrix.mtololo.com: Well, which I gave you an artifact?

[2022-03-29 14:25:19] - @killanas:matrix.mtololo.com: This is a kobe

[2022-03-29 14:25:20] - @killanas:matrix.mtololo.com: Yes

[2022-03-29 14:25:33] - @saint:matrix.mtololo.com: OK

[2022-03-29 14:25:42] - @saint:matrix.mtololo.com: I would already get a kobu today

[2022-03-29 14:29:16] - @killanas:matrix.mtololo.com: Well, there you still need to finish the cryptor so that it works correctly with all the areas, because the more it covers, the seems to work less Aver, but this is all the first to work with your hands in Asma under debugging 
 I began to cut the cryptor based on a piece of code from the morpher, but dragged on with it because the bacon in x64, and our locter and morphra for it on x86, so almost everything that I would have to cut, and some old approaches in principle did not work

[2022-03-29 14:39:50] - @killanas:matrix.mtololo.com: In short, I can give it as it is, but it is better to test. so that there were no surprises 
 Now the servicema was clinging to the servica and the LS team also worked.
